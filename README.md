===================================

The dictionaries are created from the 1-grams of the [Google Ngram](http://books.google.com/ngrams) data.

The idea of the grammatical template stems from [tripphrase](http://worrydream.com/tripphrase/).

[humanhash](https://github.com/zacharyvoase/humanhash) creates hashes (compressed) from a 256-word dictionary.
